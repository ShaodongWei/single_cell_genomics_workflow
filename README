# This is a pipeline to preprocess single cell fastq files, it inlcude steps to demultiplex, prune samples based on reads number, calculate percentage of demultiplexed reads for each sample and each barcode, quanlity control fastq files based on specified quality score, mapping reads to references to calculate a list of statistic e.g. depth, coverage, plasmid copy number, etc.
Check the help page of single_cell.sh to know how to use it. Specify path to your single cell sequencing fastq files, and other parameters, e.g. ouput, threads, memory, primers, barcodes etc., analyzed files will be in specified output directory.
